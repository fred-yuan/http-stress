## http-stress

A simple while effective HTTP and HTTPS stress testing tool that can be used to measure some types of load. It's based on the wonderful [multi-mechanize](https://github.com/cgoldberg/multi-mechanize) but instead on relying on httlib2 the test makes use of [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) which utilizes httplib3 instead. Therefore, HTTPS works very well and use of client cert authentication and CA verification is possible.

**Work in progress!**

Installation howto upcoming when i'm back from holidays. Please stay tuned!
